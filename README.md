Self-Attention GAN (SAGAN) implementation

This repository contains an implementation of SAGAN (Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network) using PyTorch.
SAGAN introduces attention mechanisms into GANs, enabling each pixel to attend to all other pixels, improving image generation quality and global coherence. 

Key features:
* Spectral Normalization for stable training
* Self-Attention layers in the generator and the discriminator
* Visualization of attention maps for analysis
* Example on MNIST

Feel free to clone, test, and experiment!
